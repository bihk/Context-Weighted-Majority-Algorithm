# CWMA - Context invariant Weighted Majoriy Algorithm 
Special relevance and applied in the field of multi-modal biometric authentication in mobile phones (Continuous Authentication)

This repository contains the code & material developed to showcase the CWMA algorithm with multi-modal (Face & Voice) and single modal but multiple classifiers on virtual identities generated from existing large datasets in each individual domain. 

The code base contains 3 programming languages - Python, Matlab & C++. For ease of use, there is a wrapper written in python that will call the respective libraries. The system will need to have the tools/software needed to compile Matlab & C++ code (Visual Studio C++ 2010 will suffice for both).

 All work done is with the staff and students at the School of Computing @ National University of Singapore
